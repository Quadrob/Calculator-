// Description : A simple program that performs arithmetic division.
//				 The program uses two integers, a and b (obtained by the user)
//				 and will perform the division of a/b and store the result in
//				 another integer c and show the result of the division using cout.
//				 Similarly it will subtract, multiply, do modulo and power using
//				 integers a and b.The program asks the user which type of
//				 calculation it should do, then asks for the 2 integers, then runs
//				 the users selected calculation and outputs the result in a user
//				 friendly formatted manner.
//				 I broke the problem into subproblems and made a method for each
//				 operation so that its easier to understand and the switch case
//				 isnt too cluttered but each step is handled by a method.
